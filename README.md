# Anscombequartet
An analysis of the [Anscombe dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet).

The dataset produced by American statistician F.J Anscombe in 1973 is discussed in a Jupyter notebook.
The dataset is an example of how useful it is to plot data before relying on summary statistics.

## Jupyter notebook
The dataset is discussed in a Jupyter notebook, giving an explanation of the data, who produced it and when.
Basic statistics are performed on the data showing the same summary statistics for the four sets.
Graphs or plots are being attempted on the data using Python packages.

## Uploading to GitHub
Once the Jupyter notebook had been created and run, I had a problem uploading this to GitHub. The issue appears to be the git commit command. This delayed completion of the assignment in the given timeframe.
