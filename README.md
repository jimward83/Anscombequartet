# Anscombequartet
An analysis of the [Anscombe dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet).

The dataset produced by American statistician F.J Anscombe in 1973 is discussed in a Jupyter notebook.
The dataset is an example of how useful it is to plot data before relying on summary statistics.

## Downloading the data
Although the dataset is well known in the field of statistics, I could not find the raw data in csv format. I Therefore had a difficulty downloading the data to my machine in order to perform basic analysis and plotting.

## Uploading to GitHub
Once the Jupyter notebook had been created and run, I had a problem uploading this to GitHub.
